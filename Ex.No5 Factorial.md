### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To  write  a logic program for finding the factorial of given number using SWI-PROLOG. 
### Algorithm:
1. STEP 1: Start the program
2. STEP 2:  Write a rules for finding factorial of given program in SWI-PROLOG.
3.   a)	factorial of 0 is 1 => written as factorial(0,1).
4.   b)	factorial of number greater than 0 obtained by recursively calling the factorial    function.
5. STEP 3: Run the program  to find answer of  query.
6. STEP 4: Stop the program.

### Program:

factorial(0,1).
factorial(A,B):-
    A>0,
    C is A-1,
    factorial(C,D),
    B is A*D.

### Output:
![311431067-0c740663-1575-4bc8-b242-074876c5bf82](https://github.com/Ritz514/AI_Lab_2023-24-120/assets/142646304/eea45561-6021-4d52-9511-de7ba11a200e)



### Result:
Thus the factorial of given number was found by logic programming.
